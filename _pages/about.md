# Welcome to my personal website

I am a Climate and Environmental Economist and currently hold the
[Einstein International Postdoctoral
Fellowship](https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/fellows-projects/einstein-fellows-professors/einstein-international-postdoctoral-fellows/)
financed by the Einstein Foundation in Berlin. I have obtained a DPhil
(PhD) in the field of Climate Econometrics from the University of Oxford
and am currently based at the Faculty of Economics and Management at TU
Berlin and the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research (PIK) as
well as the [Climate Econometrics](https://www.climateeconometrics.org/)
research group at the University of Oxford.

In my research, I make ample use of econometric time series and panel
methods to study climate change and how to address it. My research
focuses on quantifying the effects of climate policies on emission
trajectories using methods from the macro-econometrics as well as the
causal inference literature. This includes efforts to study which
policies can be the most effective at reducing emissions. I use similar
methods to create forecasting models of the energy system (e.g. the
[Open-Source Empirical Macro Model](osem)) and have published on the
economic impacts of climate change as well as on Just Transition aspects
of the Clean Energy Transition.

I contribute to the development of open-source estimation software to
disseminate the methods and techniques we develop, such as the [{gets}
R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gets/index.html)
(general to specific modelling techniques, indicator saturation, and
model selection, see also [website here](gets)) and the [{getspanel}
R-package](getspanel) (gets-type techniques for panels and causal
inference, see also [website here](getspanel)). More recently, I have
been developing the Open Source Empirical Macro Model (OSEM) as well as
the associated R package [{osem}](osem) together with co-authors.

During my DPhil studies, I was based at the School of Geography and
Environment. I remain associated with the [Climate
Econometrics](https://www.climateeconometrics.org/) project at Nuffield
College as well as with the [Institute for New Economic Thinking at the
Oxford Martin School](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Smith School
of Enterprise and the Environment](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/).

As a Clarendon Scholar, my DPhil was supported by the Clarendon Fund,
while my research was supervised by Prof Sir David F Hendry and Prof
Cameron Hepburn.

## Newest Research: 

### ***Science:*** Identifying successful climate policies

As part of an international research team, we have published the first
global assessment of climate policies in the four most critical emission
sectors in the journal *Science*.

We unveiled the first comprehensive global evaluation of 1,500 climate
policy measures from 41 countries across six continents. We identified
‘emission breaks’ and assigned them policy interventions, pinpointing
where policies may have had a large impact. The break detection
methodology, called indicator saturation estimation, developed at
Climate Econometrics, allows break indicators for all possible dates to
be examined objectively using a variant of machine learning. This
unprecedented study provides a detailed impact analysis of the wide
range of climate policy measures implemented across the planet over the
last two decades.

We have identified 63 cases of successful climate policies with large
emission reductions with the key characteristic of these successful
cases being the inclusion of tax and price incentives in well-designed
policy mixes. Our study also shows that if more countries relied on
policies like these ones, the remaining emissions gap for 2030 could be
closed by as much as 26% to 41%. The identified successful policies have
led to an average emission reduction of 19 percent. In total, the 63
policy interventions reduced emissions between 0.6 and 1.8 billion
tonnes of CO2.

For more detail on the identified policies, check out our [Climate
Policy Exporer](http://climate-policy-explorer.pik-potsdam.de/) where
you can dive deeper into our results and findings.

### ***Energy Policy:*** Identifying successful climate policies

We have recently published a paper in *Energy Policy* that considers the
dynamics of the US labour market that are associated with coal mines
closing. The paper finds that coal mine closures raise US county
unemployment rates with spatial ripple effects and that Just Transition
interventions should tailor to local conditions to alleviate impacts.

of structural unemployment in declining coal mining regions and

<!-- My research, under the supervision of Prof Cameron Hepburn and Prof Sir David Hendry, focuses on the macro-econometric estimation of climate impacts. Further research interests include spatial econometrics and remote-sensing.
I holds a degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science and an MSc from Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. Before continuing his studies at Oxford, he worked for the Austrian government and coordinated the activities in international environmental negotiations associated with Austria’s Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2018 (with a focus on climate, biodiversity, whaling and governance negotiations).
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 
Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
