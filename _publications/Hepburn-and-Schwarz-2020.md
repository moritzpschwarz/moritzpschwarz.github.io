Abstract: 

This report, written for Pictet Asset Management, seeks to dispel many of the lingering myths about climate change and sheds new light on the scale of the likely damage if decision makers fail to meet carbon emission targets. Uncertainty about climate science and economics poses challenges for business and finance. Reasonable and intelligent people frequently ask us for a reference document to set out what is known and not known about climate change, including research that is sometimes contrary to prevailing societal beliefs, if only to avoid debates about areas that are settled and instead to direct attention to the areas where further research is valuable. We have structured this report into nine areas of doubt commonly expressed about climate science and economics, each of which is broken down into points of contention. We also highlight key facts and estimates in which scholars have high levels of confidence. Each section begins with a common challenge about climate science and economics, expressed as a quotation.
